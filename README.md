## Synopsis

Please see my Lab #1 which is a ML report that showcases the California Housing Prices Dataset by several important variables - median house value vs median income, population, and number of households.

## Quickstart

Please begin by setting up a virtual environment and then running all cells in the Jupyter Notebook in sequence. To create your own virtual environment run the following code in the root directory:

`python -m venv venv`

The installation requirements are in the first cell of the notebook.

## Data-sources

The California Housing Prices Dataset comes from Kaggle. [California  Housing Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices)
